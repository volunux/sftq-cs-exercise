Solve the game "Guess a number", find a secret integer between 1 and 1000000 in less than 50 guesses. Write a function that solves the game and returns the solution by using the function
verify() which is defined with the following specification: 

    <code style ="font-family: courier">function verify(guess: integer) -> integer</code>

  Returns:
  ● 0 if the guess is the solution, your program won,
  ● -1 if the solution is smaller than the guessing parameter,
  ● 1 if the solution is bigger than the guessing parameter.
Warning: You are not allowed to call verify() more than 50 times or you lose.
